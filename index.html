                        <p>I've got so many interests, things I want to learn about and ideas I want to share. It's difficult to decide exactly what I want to write about, or where to begin....</p>

                <h5>One of my greatest passions is photography.</h5>
                        <p>I love taking candid shots of the kids playing, or recording some silly or interesting view of otherwise ordinary objects. Here are a few</p>
                <h3> Collections of my Observations...</h3>
                            <img src="./images/photog/kcrphotog1.jpg" alt="kcredwolf photography1" />
                        <p>I'm really fascinated with the depths of expresssion that can be seen in portraits, and studying resemblances in people. </p>

                        <p>I also love taking pictures of Mother Nature's beautiful landscapes and beautiful wild weather. It would be so great to have the opportunity to travel, to discover more about this amazing world we inhabit.</p>

                <h5>I also really enjoy doing just about any kind of arts and crafts.</h5>
                        <p>My grandmother was amazingly talented and creative. My earliest memories are of our weekend trips to the craft store, and all the projects we worked on together. She taught me to do crossstitch, decopage, ceramics, painting, beadwork, sewing, dollmaking... you name it- we probably made it! I loved that time with her. I don't have nearly the talent she did, but now I do get to enjoy passing some of what she taught me on to my own grand-daughter (and looking forward to it with my grandson, too- once he grows out of eating the crayons!)</p>
                <h3>A few of my Creations...</h3>
                            <img src="./images/creativ/kcrdrwgs1.jpg" alt="pics paints and pastels" />
                        <p>I especially like to re-use materials and repurpose items if I can. The only drawback being  that there is not enough time to do all the projects I would like to work on, and my apartment is way too crammed with art supplies!</p>
                            <img src="./images/creativ/kcrmxd1.jpg" alt="playdoh and other creations" />
                    <br>
                        <p>One of the cool things about being a grandma is that I don't have to worry if my drawings aren't so great, or look a little silly- the grandkids don't mind at all. And it's a great excuse to play with Play-Doh!</p>

                <h3>Puterbation... </h3>
                        <p>In the early 1980's, Apple donated a computer lab to my junior high school, and I was one of the lucky students at that time to be allowed to take programming classes. I loved it right away! I didn't have a computer lab at my high school,  but I still kept an interest, took correspondence courses in pc repair, and had some good opportunities through work to learn more about software and basic programming. In 1997, I was thrilled to finally have my own home pc and internet. That is when I first discovered VPlaces (formerly Excite VP). I taught myself html and was very involved for a while with designing graphics and building websites for my friends.</p>

                    <br>
                        <p>For the next 15+ years, I worked as a purchasing agent, and was highly involved with implemention of software and training employess to use the programs for manufacturing and production facilities. I also got to learn all about the mechanics of electronic design, from engineering and design to function and materials. I have always been so much more interested in research and problem-solvingthan any other aspectof business. At home, I continued to repair and rebuild pc's, andact as the amatuer electronics guru for family and friends. </p>
                            <img src="./images/putr/pc1.jpg" alt="pc-rebuild-repair" />
                        <p>I've spent countless hours trying to teach myself as much as I could about operating systems, mostly because I seem to constantly be fixing whatever the latest update has broken my Windows!) When time and resources allowed, I experimented with Linux and Ubunto installations, was a playtester for TheSimsOnline, and a few years ago I started to delve deeper into investigating systems processes, attempting to trace and combat viruses. I have done a fair bit of research about ethical hacking, as well as being very interested in cryptography- I think working in cybersecurity sounds like a rewarding challenge. They may not be in the same genre, but the study of machine learning and deep learning that is being used to combat cybercrime is also a key tool being developed for another area of research I'd like to be more involved in- language/behavior/communication interpretation/analysis.</p>
                <h5>I have so many ideas that I'd like to work on...</h5>
                        <p> My dream is to be able to learn code so I might be able to contribute to the development of programs that would aid these studies. I wasn't able to afford college, and at my age, getting any kind of job in tech seemed to be impossible. </p>
                        <p>I feel so blessed to have discovered and been acceped to <a href="www.launchcode.org">Launchcode</a>, which is helping me come closer to that opportunity than I ever thought I possibly could! I really loved our first unit in LC101, learning to code in Python. To be honest, I am not enjoying the web development unit so much, but I am still learning a lot. I am eager for the final unit to begin, where I can concentrate more on the areas of testing and research that I am eager to be working on. It hasn't been easy, but I enjoy the challenge, and am sincerely grateful for the experience!</p>

                <h3>My Aspirations...</h3>
                        <article cite="http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/it/future-machine-learning-could-detect-illness-your-voice">
                            <h1>Machine learning could turn a patient's voice into a diagnostic tool</h1>
                                <p>It might be easy to diagnose a cold basedon a patient’s hoarse voice, but researchers believe subtle vocal changes undetectable to the human ear can identify or predict certain difficult-to-diagnose diseases.</p>
                                <p>That’s where machine learning could step in, helping physicians detect a range of illnesses that can't be diagnosed with more traditional tests, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, according to MIT Technology Review.</p>
                                <p>Charles Marmar a psychiatrist at New York University’s Langone Medical Center is collecting voice samples from combat veterans to determine how specific characteristics like tone and pitch could help psychiatrists diagnose PTSD, traumatic brain injury or depression. Initial studies have found vocal cues can differentiate PTSD patients from healthy ones with 77% accuracy, but an influx of new data will strengthen those results.</p>
                                <p>“Medical and psychiatric diagnosis will be more accurate when we have access to large amounts of biological and psychological data, including speech features,” Marmar told MIT Technology Review.</p>
                                <p>Data analytics is becoming increasingly important in the mental health field, where illnesses can be difficult to diagnose, even for experienced clinicians.</p>
                                <p>Recently, the Army rolled out a Behavioral Health Data Portal to help diagnose PTSD or depression, adding to its data-driven approach to predict suicide risks. The ONC has also launched several pilots focused on collecting patient-reported outcome data. Industry experts have also said healthcare leaders need to expand data collection efforts to include behavioral and socio-economic factors.</p>
                                <p>The Mayo Clinic is also collecting voice data combined with remote monitoring to identify patients with coronary artery disease. Meanwhile, a company in Boston is focusing solely on developing voice-based technology that can identify postpartum depression or signs of dementia, according to the MIT publication.</p>

                <h3>Honorable Mention...</h3>
                        <blockquote cite="http://www.redwolf.org/index.php/our-animals/the-wolves">
                            <p>The Red Wolf (Canis rufus) is neither as glamorous nor as well known as its cousins, the Grey Wolf (Canis lupus) or the Coyote (C. latrans). The Red Wolf once lived here in the Eastern United States but the extinction of the passenger pigeon and predator elimination programs lead to its eradication from much of the U.S. in the early 1900’s.</p>
                            <p>Down to only 12 surviving animals in the 1970’s, thanks to captive breeding and education, the Red Wolf is making a comeback. Despite the fact that it once lived in our own backyards most Americans were unaware that the Red Wolf had ever existed while it tottered on the brink of extinction.</p>
                            <p>The Red Wolf is therefore an emblem, a mascot, of what we have to protect for we will surely lose it, and much more, if we remain unaware of its plight.</p>
